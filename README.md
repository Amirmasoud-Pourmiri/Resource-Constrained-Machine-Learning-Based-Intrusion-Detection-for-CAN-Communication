Resource-Constrained ML-Based Intrusion Detection for Secure Automotive CAN Communication

This repository contains the implementation of the paper "Resource-Constrained Machine Learningâ€“Based Intrusion Detection for Secure Automotive CAN Communication."
It provides a lightweight, efficient intrusion detection system (IDS) for the automotive Controller Area Network (CAN) using machine learning.

ðŸš— Overview

The project aims to secure CAN communication by detecting malicious or anomalous messages in resource-constrained environments.

Lightweight ML models optimized for embedded systems

Preprocessing of CAN bus traffic data

Intrusion detection framework with anomaly detection

Evaluation scripts for performance and efficiency
